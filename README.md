# Image Colorization Using GANs

This repository contains the implementation of an image colorization model using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The model is designed to convert grayscale images to their corresponding colorized versions.

## Overview
The image colorization model leverages the power of GANs to generate realistic and visually appealing colorizations. It consists of a generator network that learns to map grayscale images to colorized versions, and a discriminator network that evaluates the realism of the generated color images.

## Features
- Implementation of a GAN-based image colorization model
- Training pipeline for the generator and discriminator networks
- Evaluation metrics for assessing the quality of colorized images
- Visualization of colorization results

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
